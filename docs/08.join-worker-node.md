# Joining a New Worker Node to VelaD Control Plane

This guide describes the steps for joining a new worker node to an existing VelaD control plane.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the steps below, ensure that:

- Have a VelaD control plane running.
- You have the token for the VelaD control plane. You can get the token by running the `velad token` command on the VelaD control plane master node.
- New worker node is **Linux machine** and can access the VelaD control plane master node.
- You have SSH access to the new worker node

## Steps

1. Download VelaD to the new worker node.
```shell
curl -fsSl https://static.kubevela.net/script/install-velad.sh | bash
```

2. Run the `velad join` command on the new worker node.
    ```
    velad join --master-ip <master-ip> --token <token> --worker-name <worker-name>
    ```
   - `<master-ip>` is the IP address of the VelaD control plane master node. (Required)
   - `<token>` is the token for the VelaD control plane. (Required)
   - `<worker-name>` is the name of the new worker node. (Optional) 

3. Verify the new node has joined the control plane.
    - Use `kubectl get nodes` to check the new worker node has joined the VelaD control plane.

## Delete a Worker Node

Run the `velad uninstall` command on the VelaD on the worker node to be deleted.
