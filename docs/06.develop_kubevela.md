# Develop KubeVela with VelaD

It's easy to use VelaD to get a local KubeVela development environment. This document will show you how to create a 
KubeVela controller (vela-core) development environment.


## Prerequisites

No need for preparing a cluster. VelaD will take care of the cluster. Other tools you need is listed
in [contribution guide](https://kubevela.io/docs/contributor/code-contribute#prerequisites). 

> Note the second item "Kubernetes ..." is NOT needed.
> If you want to use cluster already exist as develop environment, please check [this doc](https://kubevela.io/docs/contributor/code-contribute#prerequisites) directly

## Steps

1. Setup Cluster and Helm Chart 
```shell
velad install --set admissionWebhooks.enabled=false --set replicaCount=0
```
This command setup k3d/k3s cluster and install vela-core with no running controller.

2. Run Vela Core
```shell
export KUBECONFIG=$(velad kubeconfig --host)
make core-run
```
This command will run KubeVela controller locally. There you go! you already have a KubeVela
development environment.
