# Access Service in VelaD

This document will show you how to access the service running in VelaD.

## Background

Typically, you can expose service in cluster in several ways.

1. LoadBalancer type Service
2. NodePort type Service
3. Ingress API

First two types both have some limitations. In VelaD cluster, exposing service through Ingress API is out of box.
In KubeVela, we can use the `gateway` trait to expose service through Ingress API.

## Using gateway trait

In VelaD, we have installed a default Ingress Controller, which is needed to use Ingress API.
The default Ingress controller is [**Traefik**](https://github.com/traefik/traefik). If you want to switch to other like
Nginx Ingress Controller, see [Switch to Nginx Ingress Controller](#switch-to-nginx-ingress-controller).

After running `velad install` command, there is one hint printed to the screen.

```shell
ðŸ’»  When using gateway trait, you can access with 127.0.0.1:8090
```

It means you can access the Application with `gateway` trait through http://127.0.0.1:8090.

For example, Run command below to apply app in VelaD cluster:
```shell
cat << EOF | vela up -f -
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  components:
    - name: hello-world
      type: webservice
      properties:
        image: crccheck/hello-world
      traits:
        - type: gateway
          properties:
            domain: testsvc.example.com
            class: traefik
            http:
              "/": 8000
EOF
```

Then access this app by:
```shell
curl -H "Host: testsvc.example.com" http://localhost:8090/
```

The output like:

```text
<pre>
Hello World


                                       ##         .
                                 ## ## ##        ==
                              ## ## ## ## ##    ===
                           /""""""""""""""""\___/ ===
                      ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
                           \______ o          _,/
                            \      \       _,'
                             `'--.._\..--''
</pre>
```

## Switch To Nginx Ingress Controller

There are three steps to switch to nginx ingress controller and using `gateway` trait.

1. Uninstall Traefik

> [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) is needed
```shell
helm uninstall traefik --namespace kube-system
```

2. Enable Ingress-nginx Addon and dependent FluxCD addon

```shell
vela addon enable fluxcd
vela addon enable ingress-nginx
```

3. Port-forward Nginx Ingress Controller To Localhost

```shell
vela port-forward addon-ingress-nginx -n vela-system
```

> We don't need to do port-forwarding for Traefik in the last section because we when `velad install`, a container is created for that.

Using the app above, only change `class: traefik` to `class: nginx` in the `gateway` trait section, run the command below:

```shell
cat << EOF | vela up -f -
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  components:
    - name: hello-world
      type: webservice
      properties:
        image: crccheck/hello-world
      traits:
        - type: gateway
          properties:
            domain: testsvc.example.com
            class: nginx
            http:
              "/": 8000
EOF
```

```shell
Now you can access the services through Ingress like:

```shell
curl -H "Host: testsvc.example.com" http://localhost:8080/
```
